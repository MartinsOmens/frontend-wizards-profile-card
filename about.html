      <!-- Areas of Low Confidence -->
      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I sometimes feel less confident when tackling complex JavaScript
          logic, performance optimization, and advanced state management in
          frameworks like React. However, I’m determined to keep practicing and
          learning until these areas become strengths.

        <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Never stop learning! Remember how far you’ve come, and how much more
          you can achieve through persistence and curiosity. Keep exploring new
          technologies and don’t let fear of failure hold you back.

        <p>
          This program has been an incredible journey so far. I’ve met amazing
          people, learned valuable lessons, and grown not just as a developer
          but also as a problem solver. I’m truly grateful for this experience.
